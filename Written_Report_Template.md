# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to determine what drives successful Kickstarter campaigns. Specifically, we were interested whether (and to what extent) launch date and fundraising goals influence the ultimate success of a campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

Pivot tables were created to view relationships between 1) launch data and success, and 2) fundraising goals and success. The data was drawn from a very large data set, which made manipulating the data challenging. Furthermore, without guidance, it would have been time-consuming and difficult to determine which independent variables to test.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The data imply that among theater campaign, those that launch in May and June see the most success. Furthermore, there seems to be a drop-off in success in December, perhaps because of the holiday season.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

There appears to be a general inverse relationship between fundraising goal and success rate among campaigns. Namely, campaigns with lower fundraising goals showed higher rates of success

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

A limitation of the data set may be not including how well campaigns are marketed, or certain popularity of a topic at a given time. In general, it is difficult to determine whether the trends observes aren't merely correlations due to some other hidden variable.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could create tables that examine the effect of more than one variable on the success rate of campaigns. In this way, we could have a better understanding of what truly drives success.
